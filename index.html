    <h1 style="color:rebeccapurple"> I'm Gabriela </h1>
    <p> I am a member of the Navajo tribe from Gallup, NM.
        This is the Navajo Nation seal.
        It is what is printed on our flag. </p>

    <p> This past January was my first time visiting New York. &#128509; It was a great experience.
        I now understand why they call it the "Concrete Jungle" and found myself missing the mountains too much.</p>

    <p> I love to roller skate outdoors. It is one of my main hobbies.
    It is a fun and exciting way to stay fit. </p>
